# RainbowTables
This was part of my security asssesment, during the course of this project I had difficulty finding resources and implementations. This is provided as an open source example with links to other important resources to help further understanding for other students.

A rainbow table is a precomputed table of hash values and their corresponding plaintext passwords, used primarily for cracking password hashes . It offers a space-time tradeoff by using less processing time than a brute-force attack but requiring more storage than a simple lookup table, making it an efficient way to find a password from its hash.

A very clear breakdown and implementation:
