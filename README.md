# RainbowTables
A rainbow table is a precomputed table of hash values and their corresponding plaintext passwords, used primarily for cracking password hashes . It offers a space-time tradeoff by using less processing time than a brute-force attack but requiring more storage than a simple lookup table, making it an efficient way to find a password from its hash.
